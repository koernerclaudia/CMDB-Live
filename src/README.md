# cMDb (Claudia's Movie Database)

This project is still WIP.

This is part 2 - building the frontend with React.
For Part 1 [go here](https://github.com/koernerclaudia/CMDB) to find out more about the API, the database and the server-side technologies used.

## Purpose

This is my version of a front end for a movie database; set up during my Full Stack Web Dev Training with [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/). 
The project is built on the MERN Stack -> MongoDB, Express, React & Node.js.

The project is supposed to demonstrate full-stack JavaScript development, including APIs (REST), web server
frameworks, databases, business logic, authentication, data security, and more.

## Built & Technologies

A frontend was created using
- React

## Content & Functionalities

The Database consists of 2 collections:
- Movies
- Users

Users will be able to
- set up an account and get authenticated (username, password, email info will be necessary)
- Log in and out
- Change their user information
- Set up a list of favourite movies, add & delete movies from it
- De-register / Delete their account

The information about movies will include title, description, main actors, genre, genre info, director and year of birth of the director.
